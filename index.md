# About Me
I am a university student at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) specialising in software engineering. While my career and identity in engineering are in their early stages, I have aspirational goals not necessarily involving becoming the greatest and most innovative engineer, but instead, above all else, simply making a notable difference in areas I work in and care about.
